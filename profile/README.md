We are pioneering the future of Agent Native Financial Infrastructure, building the foundational layer that empowers the next generation of AI Agents to seamlessly participate in the digital economy.

## Our Vision

We believe that AI Agents will become primary participants in the digital economy, requiring purpose-built financial infrastructure that is secure, scalable, and inherently designed for agent-to-agent interactions. Our mission is to create this infrastructure, making it as natural for AI Agents to engage in financial transactions as it is for humans today.

## Core Projects
